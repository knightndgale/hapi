# Helper Extract Rule
- Helpers should be extracted to a folder.
- folder is in ./helpers.
- example of helpers, date formatter, calculations, etc... make use of dayjs for the date formatter. install it if missing.
- Implement testing and put it into the folder ./__tests__
- Do the testing every time we add functions and if it does not have any testing counterpart.
