# Typing Rules

## Schema Management
- Always refer to the `./types/schema` directory for type definitions
- Do not create new types directly in page files
- Use Zod schemas for collection types and basic types
- Infer types from Zod schemas rather than declaring them manually

## Extended Types
- When extending types for populated Directus collections:
  - Create extended schemas for collections with related data
  - Name format: `Extended[CollectionName][Relation]Schema`
  - Example: `ExtendedUserRoleSchema` for users with role relations

## Naming Conventions
- Schema files: `[collection_name].schema.ts`
- Type files should match their collection names
- Keep types close to their related schemas

## Restrictions
- Do not modify existing enums without explicit instructions
- All new types must be documented
- Avoid any/unknown types unless absolutely necessary
