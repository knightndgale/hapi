# API Rule and Action Rule

- Do not implement api fetching.
- Use only dummy data to mock the pages you created. put a placeholder function for the api that I will adding later on.
- API Function call should be added into the folder called ./actions and name the file according to it's collection name. Like the [event.action.ts](mdc:actions/event.action.ts) or [guest.action.ts](mdc:actions/guest.action.ts)
