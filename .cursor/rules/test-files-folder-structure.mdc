## Directory Structure
- All test files must be placed in appropriate `__tests__` directories
- Follow this structure:
  ```
  __tests__/
  ├── helpers/      # Helper function tests
  ├── components/   # Component tests for ./components
  ├── pages/        # Page tests
      └──pages/*/components/    # Page components
  └── utils/        # Utility function tests
  ```

## Test packages
- All test files should use vitest from the [package.json](mdc:package.json)

## Naming Conventions
- Test files: `[component-name].test.tsx` or `[function-name].test.ts`
- Test suites should match their implementation file names
- Test directories should mirror the source code structure

## Best Practices
- Keep test files close to their implementation
- Group related tests in describe blocks
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Include both positive and negative test cases
