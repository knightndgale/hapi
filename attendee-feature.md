Attendee Book / List Feature

I want to add a guest book with link feature.
Where the user can add into their events page a guest and redirected into the guest list.
This guest list will have first and last name and their response from the invitation.
The user should be able to add, delete or update a guest.
The guest should have a link or a qr image that the user can share to the guest.
The guest who scans the qr or goes to the link will see a page with a simple information
of the event and their name together with a way to respond into their invitation.
If they agree to join the invitation the guest should see all the information for the event.

Attendee will be able to add images of 3 during the wedding through a QR code

- 5mb limit
- image type should be selfie, groupie and picture newly wed

Attendee will be able to add images through the RSVP

- Should be shown during the post ceremony while they put their new images through the QR code
